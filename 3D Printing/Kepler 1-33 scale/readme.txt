The Kepler Mission, NASA Discovery mission #10,
is specifically designed to survey a portion of 
our region of the Milky Way galaxy to discover 
dozens of Earth-size planets in or near the 
habitable zone and determine how many of the 
billions of stars in our galaxy have such planets.

Printable files are of Kepler spacecraft in a configuration which they may be assembled. 
This model was created for educational purposes, and as such files are scaled for durability where appropriate. The overall assembly is roughly at 1/33 scale

Recommended print settings:
-Solid print density
-Soluble support structure
-Existing file orientation (printer varying)

Reference files can be found at: http://kepler.nasa.gov/images/3d/

The following software was used to create the printable files:
-Blender 2.77
-NetFabb Private 5.2
