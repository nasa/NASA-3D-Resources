NASA-3D-Resources
=================

Welcome to the 3D Resources github site. This is a growing collection of 3D models, textures, and images from inside NASA. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive repository for 3D models, images, textures, and visualizations. These assets are free and without copyright.

Please read the [usage guidelines][usage]. NASA [intranet interface][webinterface] for these resources.

We welcome feedback and comments. Tell us how you're using our models and let us know what you think: arc-special-proj@lists.nasa.gov
